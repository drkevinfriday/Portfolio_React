          My name is Kevin Friday, I have lived in Austin texas since 2010.  I started my education at the University of Minnesota with the aim to be a Business Manager.  During the pursuit of my education I worked as an operations specialist at UPS with the goal of furthering my real world education. That experience soon turned into a career and 14 years later, I still have the itch to learn. I’ve had a fascination with figuring out the way things work, a passion for technology. To quench my thirst for my two passions I enrolled in the Austin Community College computer programming degree program in 2019. I’m currently on track to graduate with an associate degree spring 2022 with plans to pursue a BA in the summer of 2023.  My goal in taking the UT Full-Stack Bootcamp is to build on my current programming knowledge.
